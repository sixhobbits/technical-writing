# Technical Writing

For some reason, there are only a relatively small number of people who are interested in both technology and language. If you are one of them, technical writing can be a great profession, or means of generating a side income. 

This repository is a collection of technical writing resources. Pull requests to add more resources are highly encouraged.

## Writing Resources

[Technical Writing Resources](./resources.md) is a list of books and other resources to help you become a better technical writer

## Publishing Resources

[Publishing Resources](./write-for-us.md) provides information on where you can publish your technical posts, and who will pay you for them.


## About
I have been writing technical articles on a freelance basis for a number of years. I'm always surprised that while there are thousands of posts and resources out there relating to helping you become a better (programmer|founder|data scientist|anything else) there is very little about technical writing, and many people don't even know that technical writing is a thing that exists and that pays. 

This is my little attempt to fill that gap. I plan to extend it in future with information about publishing companies and writing tools. If you have suggestions for more sections, or want to add to existing sections, please submit a pull request. If you're not comfortable with git, [Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/sixhobbits) with your suggestions or use one of the other contact optoins at the bottom of [my website](https://dwyer.co.za).
