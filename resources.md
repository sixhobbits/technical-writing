# Technical Writing
There are a number of resources relating to technical writing, scattered around the web and in print. This is a (growing) list of technical writing resources. Pull requests to add titles are encouraged. Please add the title and a brief summary following the style below. For articles that are available on the web, provide a link.

## Books
*The following books are not all specific to technical writing. However, their advice on general writing definitely applies to technical writing as well.*

### 'On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction' by William Zinsser
Zinsser describes writing as a craft, comparing it to carpentry. He focuses on teaching you how to edit, claiming that first drafts are never good. The earlier chapters provide general writing and editing advice, while the later ones are topic-specific and cover travel writing, technical writing, memoir writing, etc. 

### 'The Elements of Eloquence' by Mark Forsyth
This book teaches the lost art of rhetoric in a highly entertaining fashion. Each chapter is an explanation -- containing many hilarious and self-describing examples -- of a simple rule to make your writing sound better and be more persuasive. You can read it cover-to-cover, or open it at random. 

### 'On Writing' by Stephen King
This book is half an autobiography of Stephen King and half writing advice. Although it is aimed more at fiction writers, the advice is generic and sound. The intimate descriptions of the hardships King went through before becoming a famous writer are inspiring.

### 'Trees, maps and theorems' by Jean-luc Doumont 
Doumont runs training courses on scientific and technical communication. His book, subtitled 'Effective communication for rational minds', is aimed at technical people who want detailed and practical advice about how to communicate clearly. It does this in a highly structured way with plenty of examples. Later chapters also give advice on presentations, graphical displays and posters. It's also an obsessively edited book. Each minimalist double-page spread has one column of body text and three other columns for common questions, illustrations and examples –– and if you look closely you'll see that the paragraphs have been tweaked to be perfectly rectangular. 

### 'Style: Toward Clarity and Grace' by Joseph M. Williams
A slightly older book but still very worth a read. William's strength lies in identifying and naming what it is about difficult sentences that actually makes them difficult for humans to parse. The book starts at the level of individual sentences, walks through plenty of examples of how to polish them for maximal clarity, and later moves onto showing how to build coherent paragraphs and larger bits of text. 

### 'Practical Typography' by Matthew Butterick
Formatting and layout of text on a page or screen is an area of writing that's often overlooked or thought of as "someone else's job". However, with the modern prevalence of independent web publishing, where the writer and typographer will often be the same person, it's useful to know the basics of good typography. In describing their typography, Butterick also covers concepts valuable to technical writers such as effective emphasis and how to best present lists and hierarchies of headings.

The book is available online only at http://practicaltypography.com/ -- as payment, Butterick encourages a donation or a purchase of one of his excellent fonts.

### 'The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century' by Steven Pinker
Linguist Steven Pinker takes an analytical approach to writing in this style guide, with chapters about reverse-engineering good prose, seeing the grammatical trees in sentences in order to untangle them, and how a writer's intimate knowledge of a subject may distort their writings about it (the biggest problem with much academic and technical writing). Much time is also spent investigating the rules of English grammar and dispelling the many myths that have grown up around it.

### 'Technical Blogging' by Antonio Cangiano
This book is, as you may have guessed from the title, specific to technical blogging. "Successful people often get recognition by teaching what they know. Blogging is a reliable path to do that, while gaining influence in the process." Unlike most of the others here, it doesn't focus as much on writing well, but more about how to set up a technical blog, how to promote it and how to find time to write.

## Articles

### 'How to Write with Style' by Kurt Vonnegut
Vonnegut presents 8 concise rules. He reminds us to 'sound like ourselves' -- something which is perhaps more difficult but still important in technical writing. http://www.novelr.com/2008/08/16/vonnegut-how-to-write-with-style.

### Material.io's writing guide
This aims at language use for user interfaces, but it has many nice rules with concrete, short examples for each. The sections on Tone and Punctuation are applicable to general technical writing.

The original essays can be found here https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP78-00915R001400200001-3.pdf and a higher level write-up about them here https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2017/jul/14/cias-style-guide/

## Videos

### The Craft of Writing Effectively by Larry McEnerney

## Meta

### Good Plain English: The problem with writing manuals
