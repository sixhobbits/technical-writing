# Software and tools

"A bad worker blames their tools" -- tools will not help you become a better writer: only practice will do that. That said, why do repetitive manual work when we have robots to do it for us.

## Linters

In coding, 'linting' refers to automatically detecting common errors or potential errors, such as unused variables. Text linters use the same idea. You can think of them as advanced spellcheckers.

### Alex

[Alex](https://github.com/get-alex/alex) is a command-line utility that finds gender favoring, polarizing, race related, religion inconsiderate, or other unequal phrasing in text.

### Proselint

[Proselint](https://github.com/amperser/proselint) is a command-line utility that collects best practices and common writing errors from several different language guides.

### Vale
[Vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) provides linting through customized style rules. It also has a [VSCode extension](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-vscode)

## API Documentation

API documentation is a technical content deliverable, containing instructions about how to effectively use and integrate with an API.

### Swagger

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/solutions/api-documentation/) Swagger takes the manual work out of API documentation, with a range of solutions for generating, visualizing, and maintaining API docs.
